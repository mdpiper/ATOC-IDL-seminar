# ATOC IDL seminar

These are the example programs used 
in the IDL seminar given on 2015 January 29
to ATOC grad students at CU-Boulder.
See the [wiki](https://github.com/mdpiper/ATOC-IDL-seminar/wiki) 
for the agenda and schedule.

It's best to include the directory containing
these files in your IDL path
(e.g., as a project in the IDL Workbench).
